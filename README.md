### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Women Topic in Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Zhuohan(Amber) Zhang

+ Project summary: This report analyzes the Philosophy Project Data to explore different Philosophy school's attitudes on female and to check whether philosophers' gender bias exist. From data perspective, I want to see What are different philosophy schools' viewpoints on female? What are main topics when they discussed about women? And is Aristotle hostile to women? By applying data mining, statistical analysis and visualization, I explain above questions by using data.
